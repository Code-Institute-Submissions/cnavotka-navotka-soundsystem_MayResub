# Navotka Sound System

This project is based on myself. I am a DJ and producer. The styles of music that I play are dub, breakbeat, hip hop, bass and experimental.
The idea is to showcase myself, let the people know more about me and get some gigs.

Finished project in different devices:

## Project Resubmission
This is a resubmission, as per I talked with Student Care, I only need to change the points I failed. 
* LO 2 2.2 Fails to pass through the official validator (Jigsaw) by a single case.
* LO 2 2.6 Bootstrap grid isn't utilized well on the gallery pages for small screen sizes. The navbar should have been ideally a collapsible burger bar which would allow users to navigate sections without any hassle. Additional: External links should open up in a new tab.
* LO 3 3.2 Wireframes or relevant screenshots are missing.
* LO 3 3.9 Empty CSS file should be removed.

## UX
The website is aimed at people who like this type of music. The colour palette mimicks the 70's as it is the origin of those beats. In this way I can show possible customers that even though I play mostly new tunes, I am rooted in the origins of the genre.

Audiophiles are always looking for the new "thing" or music they don't know. The user can find recommendations of new and classic songs, plus a link to my Soundcloud.
The wireframes are made with Balsamiq, the pictures are availabe in the folder /assets/images and here:

## Features
### Home
The user will get an insight into my music career and my musical recommendations (because I wouldn't be able to update the project once is uploaded to GitHub, some of the new tracks will be new up to 23/03/2021).

### Gallery

Pictures of some of my previous shows, some gear and records. The idea is to satisfy the curiosity of the user.

No errors in Jigsaw, just the Bootstrap file

As per CI, should ignore that error
