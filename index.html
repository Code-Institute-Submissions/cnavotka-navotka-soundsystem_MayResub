    <p> Official website for Navotka Sound System, two turntables, one mixer and lots of bass.
Dub, breakbeat, glitch, hip hop and bass. Argentine DJ and producer based in the West Coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>Since he was a kid, Navotka was always interested in music. He wanted and got to be in charge of the sound in plays at school and liked hanging around with his boombox.
As a teenager, he started to become interested in hip hop, and after he get his first turntables he started to play in house parties and in bands.
He has played with bands like Timmy O’Tool and Xampari as DJ and looper.
In the late 90’s, he started to be more involved with the underground electronic scene in Buenos Aires and finally embraced breakbeat and dub as his main sound. He was involved with different crews, like Seven South, TechnoActivity and Dub Army.
He has been resident DJ at different events around Buenos Aires, like La Cigale, Cluster and GrooveStar. He also played internationally in countries such as Paraguay, Brazil, Poland and Czech Republic.
During his sets, you can perceive the wide range of influences in his music, from tango and ska to punk and folk.
